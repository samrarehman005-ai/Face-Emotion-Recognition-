# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) – MATLAB

This project implements a **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** system using **MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox**.  
The system preprocesses facial images, applies **data augmentation**, and trains a **deep learning model** to classify human emotions.

## 🚀 Features
- Face detection and region extraction
- Image preprocessing:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Image resizing
  - Noise reduction
  - Normalization
- Data augmentation:
  - Rotation
  - Flipping
  - Zooming
  - Translation
- Deep learning–based emotion classification
- Model training and evaluation
